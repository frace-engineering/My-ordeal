        <p>
            Once upon a time in the little village of Umuofor in Okija, Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State, in the realy 21st century, the God of the universe intiated the convergence of two charming souls ever lived. A perceived witch-hunting and disappointment turned to be the beginning of a memorable life
            In a secluded BQ owned by Mr Uliagbafusi lives the family of Mr and Mrs Chinedu Oduozor who migrated from Umuezeani Village in Awo-Omamma, Orlu East LGA of Imo state and a barchelor from Umuatugbu-oma Akegbe-Ugwu Awkunanaw, in Nkanu West LGA of Enugu State --PHCN staff--
            Engr Ugwu Friday --fundly called "Oga Anyi"-- was redeployed from Nnewi Business Unit to Okija servic center as officer-1 Operations to assist the Assistant Manager --Engr Ikueze-- in running the affairs of PHCN within the communities in Okija. It was in the cool of a Friday evening. An elegant soul, fundly called "Ada Nne" walked through the twin iron gate to the compound housing the twin one-Bedroom flat.
            Nchekwube is 5ft 3inch tall on atletic-build chocholate body. Her long legs and curvy body makes it virtually unthinkable for a man to pass her on the road without looking back. Ada-Nne is a religious lady and a catholic faithful. She is an only daughter to the family of Mr and Mrs Leonard Oduozor. She came to stay with the elder brother while preparing for her PolyJamb Exams. Very innocent and pure in the likes of virgins
            ,she carried herelf magestically within the hood hence the rare respect for a girl of her age. 
            </p><br>
            <br>
            <p>After the pleasantries on that cool evening, we seldom talk to each other but always have communication through eye contacts and that sparked undesirable mixed emotions from Chinedu, her elder brother.
                It became a serious issue to the extent that he don't go out for his daily job as shoul just to keep close eye on the only sister but the continued impediment seem to shift the heart and mind of the angel to what Chinedu detaste most.
                It get to the point that when he had to travel outside the local government for a contract execution that took them nine days, he had to take the family out of the house to stay with a family friend.
                A day came and it happened.
                In the beautiful morning of the blessed second day of the week, in of the maternity homes in the naighbouring village, Mrs Leonard Oduozor was with the sister in-law. They were expecting a baby. At the appointed time, the cry of a baby was heard.
                It was 0645Hrs of April 21st 1991 that witnessed the coming of Doraty Nchekwube Oduozor. There was joy and jubilation in the home of Leonard Oduozor for the candle that was shown and lighted, the only daughter. Mrs Oduozor was looked after like 
                the queen she is and Nchekwube grew in the fear of God and has respect for both the young and old. At the age of 21yrs she has grown to represent all that a man need in a woman to have a happy home. Trouly, "he that finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from God".
                In Nchekwubelies the beauty of life. 
                The manifestation of true love began late 2010 and grew in intensity to the level of cohabitation. At this time it was evident that the what must be must be and we started nursing that feeling that exist within Husband and Wife.
                A date was chosen and families gathered unit their son and daughter in the devine institution of marriage. The 17th day of May 2014 marked the day of free access to body and soul of an angel. I was blessed with a loving wife. The staturtory wine carriage was put forward due to the death of a great in-law,
                My father-in-law who died in the month of August 2014. the family was devastated.
                <br><br>Things and time went by and on the 18th day of June 2016, the traditional marriage ceremony was held and Angel became fully "Mrs Nchekwube Dorathy Ugwu" nee Oduozor.

            </h3>
           <p> My lovely wife Mrs Nchekwube Dorathy Ugwu died mysteriouly on the 16th day of February 2017 (on a Thursday) with pregnacy which is almost due for delivery.
            Her W2 Tecno phone was stolen on the 17th February 2017 along side my Samsung Tablet (SIMless) which was latter discovered was stolen by a "man of god", pastor Chinwendu Ezenagu.
            Her body was deposited at Akwudo Motuary on the evening of 16th February 2017 from there to St. Martins, Enugu on the 21st.
            Her body was laid to rest on the 9th day of March 2017. It grieved my heart to loose my newly married wife to the forces of darkness. The cause of her death is not known till date. 
            The pain was becoming too much for me to bear.
            </p>
            <p> 
            It is true I married her on the 18th day of June 2016 but we have been staying together since November 2012. She has been my friend with a loving heart, so caring.

            <p>The deat of my wife came with chalenges from my in-law family which made some people think so many things but God almight took control and everything was setled and they allowed the burial to hold.
            I am not forgeting that on the 21st day of February 2021 was my baby boy removed from her stomach and was buried according to tradition.
            He was a handsome baby boy, my photocopy.  <br>My prayer was that God will be with you to guide you on the way untill you come back to me, both mother and son. Only then will my juy be full

            Life after the death of my lovely wife (Mrs Nchekwube Dorathy Ugwu).
        </h1>
        <p>
            To be honest, you never can wish your enemy the loss of a loved one. I wasn't easy for me throughout the murning period. I was unable to stay at a place, continually was my mind restless.
            It became so serious that when I am at Nsukka, I will feel like going to my root-family and even when I get there I will feel like going back to Nsukka.
            It was only God that comforted me and gave me strength to carry on.
        </p>
        <h3>
            An angel came my way.
        </h3>
        <p>
            It was around 1600Hrs sometime in early 2018 that my eyes beheld this angel. She looks very gorgeous and elegant. Not just the physical look but my spirit was at peace with the lady I saw.
            She was assigned to work with me as a merketer. I was so relaxed in spirit that she noticed I was in love.
            <span>The problem surfaced</span> she was in a relationship. My spirit said "she is your wife" and it all started like play, a dangerous play.
            Thinking of her past and never wanted to leave the man she was dating, she made effort to ensure that her bride price was paid.
            But what God has purposed for his child will surly come to pass. I insisted that she has been given me as wife in the spirit realm and no man will take her from me.
            We prayed and fasted and made consultations and finnaly she was told to mary her husband - Engr Ugwu Friday B.
            There were chalenges and temptations in-between but the will of God prevailed and on August 29 2020, I paid her dowry by the grace of God.
            On the 30th day of October 2022, we celebrated our traditional marriage in Dim-Amoke Ekuma village in Ibagba-ani. 
            <br>
            She travailed with child and on the 21th day of April 2021, Mmezechukwu Ugwu was born.

        <p>
            On the evening hours of the 21th day of April 2021, at Nsukka in the maternity hospital by Ogwulugwu Road, a boy was born to the family of Engr and Mrs Ugwu Friday Bathlomew.
            He was named Mmezuchukwu Ugwu and baptisimal name of David at a methodist church at Ugwunkwo in Nsukka town. <br>
            He grew up to be a loving child who is loved by everyone that come close to him. Living with the mother and visited on monthly basis by the ever loving dad (Engr Ugwu Friday).
            He was dedicated to the alter of God in two separate occasions, at Nsukka on .... and Akegbe Ugwu Awkunanaw on 26th December 2021.
            He fell ill afterwards in January 2022 which lasted for 9-days.
            On the 3rd day of April 2022, Mmezuchukwu David Ugwu fell sick again and like a joke, he was rushed to the hospital on the 7th day of April 2022 after haven been administered with some malaria and thyphoid syrups but the illness persisted.
            On that faithful day, stories came that the sickness is not ordinary and should be haldled in a spiritual way. We did whatever we were asked/directed to do.
            I broke my heart to see my first son pass out in pains to the extent of vomitting blood. I sheed tears uncontrollably on the expressway when my car we were traveling with refused to move. 
            It pained me that my only son was dieing and I was unable to help.   <br>
            He died and was buried on the 8th day of April 2022 when every arangement were made to celebrate his birthday come 21th April 2022.
            People tried to console me and my family but every thing said was like nothing to us. We only depended on God almighty to heal our wound as we pray that Mmezuchukwu David Ugwu will come back to the family that loves him so much.
            Mmmeze! as fundly called by every one lived a short and sweet life but died a very painful and agonizing death. <br> Mmezu lived eleven months 17 days before his death.
            
            May his gentle and sweet soul rest in the bossom of the God almighty.

            The dream.
        </h2>
        <p>
            After the demise and enternment of my dear wife on the 9th day of March 2017, I saw her in a dream leaving the house with a man and she gave me a sign that she is coming. 
            I looked at myself and I said "she is my wife, why is she leaving the house with a stranger posing as her husband". <br>
            when I met Oluchi, known also as Amara George Juliet Alami around February 2018, my mind went back to the dream. The natural bonding was there though she was in a relationship 
            with one Mr Ebuka Nzude from Aku-Nsukka. My spirit said she is my wife to come. Clearly, Amarachi was sent to me by the gods who took my first wife Nchekwube Ugwu.  <br>
            Again I had a dream and saw my wife when she was going out of the house like she was on an errand. She left the house as a dark complexion lady but came back a fair complexion lady.
            The dream confirmed to me that Oluchi was sent to comfort me as a loving wife so I had to stick to the love I have for her and we eventually got married on the 31st day of October 2020.

        </p>
        <p>
            I remember meditating about having a baby boy sice Ilost me my first son when Nchekwube died. I said to God, truely you sent Amarachi to be my wife and to comfort me, my joy will be complete knowing that she will come with my son.
            Not only will she bear me a son but she will give birth on the 21 <sup>th</sup> day of April which is the birthday of my first wife, Nchekwube.
            <span>Just to prove himself, the Almighty God made name for himself.</span>On the 21 <sup>st</sup> day of April 2021, a chile was born intothe family my family, our family, the family of Engr anf Mrs Friday Ugwu.
            I first called him <span>Agunnaya</span> because he willingly followed me to the land of the living in my dream while she was still in the womb.
            The tiger followed me (I practically carried him from the dreaded place onto the world).
            <br>Agunnaya is my handsome boy, a godly child.
            <br>He is a promise kept.
            <br>Agunnaya is a promise kept.
            <br>I named him <span>Mmezechukwu.</span>
